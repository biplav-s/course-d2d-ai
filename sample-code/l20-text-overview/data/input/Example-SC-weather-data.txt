Overall, it was the fifth warmest year on record for the state,
mainly due to the extremely warm minimum temperatures
observed in 2020. The temperatures at many locations across
the state during the warmest part of the calendar year seemed
much milder compared to 2019. The statewide average
maximum temperature from May to October was 84.3°F, and
unlike 2019, many stations reported between 30 and 40 fewer
days with high temperatures at or above 90°F.

The statewide precipitation total for 2020 was 59.77", which was 11.88" above
normal, making it the sixth wettest year on record (since 1895) for South Carolina.
The year was the wettest on record at Greenville-Spartanburg Airport (73.70"), and
for many other locations, their annual totals ranked in the top five wettest years.
The stations at Caesars Head and Jocassee recorded over 100" of rain. Jocassee,
which set a new annual statewide precipitation record in 2018 (123.45 inches),
was only three inches shy of breaking that record in 2020.
The above-normal precipitation across the Carolinas in February and May caused
flooding along portions of the Santee and Pee Dee river basins.

2020 Statewide Average Temperatures, Departures and Rankings
The statewide average temperature for 2020 was 64.7°F, which was 2.3°F above
average, making it the fifth warmest year on record (since 1895) for South Carolina.
2020 was the third-warmest year on record for Charleston, tying 2016, with an
annual average temperature of 68.1°F, 2.4°F above the long-term average.
While increased precipitation and cloud cover contributed to the cooler than normal
May, the driving force behind the warmer than average year was due to the recordbreaking high minimum temperatures. From May to October, the statewide
minimum temperature average was 64.7°F, 2.2°F above normal. Overall, the
annual minimum temperature average of 54.3°F for 2020 is the warmest on record,
3.5°F above the long-term mean.
January 2020
February 2020
High temperatures at the beginning of
the month were well above normal, with
some stations recording maximum
temperatures in the mid- to upper-70s,
contributing to the fourteenth warmest
January on record for the state. On
January 11, a strong squall-line
produced severe weather across the
state, including an EF2 tornado, with
maximum wind speeds of 130 mph,
which caused considerable damage to
North-Central High School in Kershaw
County and an EF1 damaged cars at
Loris High School in Horry County on
January 13. At the end of the month,
wintry precipitation fell across portions of
the Piedmont and Upstate. Up to 1.50
inches of snow were observed in the
northern parts of Oconee, Greenville,
and Spartanburg counties.
February 2020 was the fifth
wettest February on record, with
a statewide precipitation total of
7.17 inches. Some locations
across the state recorded one of
their wettest winters on record,
including Columbia, Florence,
and Greenville. Due to the
above-normal precipitation
across the Pee Dee and Santee
river basins, low-lying areas
reported flooding. Lake Wateree
rose to 105 feet, five feet above
the lake's full pool level of 100
ft. and stayed high for nearly two
weeks in the middle of the
month. The water rose high
enough to enter into multiple
houses on the lakeshore, but the
flooding was not widespread
across the region.

Overview of
April 13th Outbreak
March 2020
April 2020
The clash of cold, dry air over the Central U.S. with warm,
moist air over the Southeast U.S. provided the set-up for a
significant tornado outbreak from April 12-13, 2020. The
system developed early Saturday (4/11), and on Easter
Sunday (4/12), the storm system spawned tornadoes
across six states, including two powerful EF4s in
Mississippi. The severe weather continued overnight and
into early Monday (4/13) morning, where it impacted the
entire state of South Carolina. There were twenty-eight
(28) confirmed tornadoes from the outbreak, including the
first EF4 in the state since November 1995. This total
accounted for more than half of the total number of
tornadoes in 2020. More details are available via our
Event Report.
March 2020 was the seventh warmest March on record, with a statewide average temperature of
60.5°F, nearly seven degrees above the long-term average. There were 43 maximum
temperature records tied or broken during the month. The station at Caesars Head recorded a
high of 80°F on the 28th, the fourth earliest occurrence on record. The Florence Regional Airport
recorded a high of 90°F on the 28th, the third earliest date of record at the location. On the
29th, the morning low in Spartanburg was 68°F, which was 29°F above the average minimum
temperature of 41°F, and the same low temperature was observed in downtown Charleston.

Statewide Precipitation: 6.70”
4th Wettest on Record
Precipitation during May was above average across
much of the state, making it statewide the fourth
wettest May on record. Locations in the Pee Dee
reported totals over ten inches, and for some stations
in the region, May 2020 became the wettest May on
record.
On May 27, Tropical Storm Bertha formed off the South
Carolina coast and made landfall near Bulls Bay before
tracking northwest across the Pee Dee region. Bertha
produced heavy rain on top of already saturated soils in the
area, which contributed to additional flooding issues across
portions of the Catawba and Pee Dee river basins.
The weather pattern during June 2020 was relatively calm, punctuated by a few severe
weather events as cold fronts moved across the region. Most storm reports for the month
noted heavy rain, strong winds, up to 50 mph, and dime- to quarter-sized hail. The main weather
story for June was
below average high
temperatures
around the middle
of the month. Fortythree (43) record
low maximum
temperatures were
either broken or tied
on June 14 - 19.
Over those six days,
high temperatures
only reached the low
60s at some
locations, nearly
fifteen degrees lower
than normal for
June.
July 2020
August 2020 Hurricane Isaias made
landfall near Ocean Isle
Beach, North Carolina, on
August 4. As the storm
moved across eastern North
Carolina, it produced
widespread rain totals
between three and six
inches in South Carolina,
which resulted in some local
rivers rising to minor flood
stage and coastal flooding
in Horry County. The core of
Hurricane Isaias' strongest
winds remained offshore of
the South Carolina coast.
Hurricane Isaias spawned
one weak tornado in
Georgetown County.
More details are available
via our Event Report.
A surface boundary stalled
over the state at the beginning
of the month, causing heavy
rainfall along portions of the
coast and the Central
Savannah River Area. There
were multiple reports from
Georgetown and Horry
counties of 48-hour rainfall
totals ending on July 8 of over
five inches from the event. A
CoCoRaHS observer near
Hunting Island State Park in
Beaufort County recorded a
24-hour total of 9.95 inches
and a two-day total of over
twelve inches. A low-pressure
that formed along the stalled
front strengthened into
Tropical Storm Fay off the
North Carolina coast on July
10, causing minimal impacts
to South Carolina.
The end of July and the beginning of August were the warmest
parts of the year. During the two weeks, maximum temperatures
climbed into the upper-90s, with a few locations reporting 100°F.
Heat advisories were issued for heat index values between 105-
110°F.
September 2020
October 2020
After Hurricane made along the
Alabama coast on September 15, it
moved across the Southeast. There
were no significant gusts overland.
However, Sally's remnants produced
twelve tornadoes across the state, one
in Dorchester County, two in Florence
County, and nine in and around Lake
Marion's northern extent. The strongest
tornado spawned by the storm was an
EF1, with estimated maximum winds of
105 mph, which snapped and uprooted
trees and caused minimal structural
damage to a few homes near
Reevesville. Most of the heaviest rain
from Tropical Storm Sally was located
on the eastern side of the center of
circulation. Portions of Orangeburg and
Sumter counties recorded up to nine
inches of rain, while the rest of the state
reported at least two inches.
At the end of the month, Hurricane Zeta made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana (October 28),
and raced off to the northeast, producing severe weather and localized flash flooding in the
Upstate and Midlands (October 29). Wind gusts of over 50 mph were observed in parts of the
Upstate, including a gust of 59 mph recorded at the Anderson Airport and a gust of 54 mph
observed at the Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport.
Hurricane Delta made landfall near Creole, Louisiana, on October 9 and as the storm crossed the
Southeast, intense storms moved into the area (October 10 – 11). Many communities in the
Midlands reported downed trees and snapped limbs. An EF1 tornado, with maximum winds of 105
mph, crossed Interstate 95 in Dillon County, snapped trees, damaged a billboard and the roof of a
nearby shed. Another EF1 touched down in Horry County, near Conway, damaging multiple
structures.
More details are available via our Event Report.
November 2020
December 2020
The state felt the impacts of another tropical
cyclone as up to ten inches of rain fell in
portions of the Pee Dee (November 11 – 14),
resulting from Hurricane Eta, which made
landfall in Florida on November 8 and moved
north along the Southeast coast.
November 2020 was the second warmest
November since 1895 statewide. There were
close to 30 maximum temperature records tied
or broken, and nearly 100 high minimum
temperature records broken during the month.
The extremely warm minimum temperatures
caused the higher-than-normal average
temperature.
Because of the warm overnight temperatures,
there were 21 days of fog in the Midlands, with
less than a quarter-mile of visibility on nine of
those days.
Dense Fog in Downtown Columbia on Nov 27
Downtown Columbia on Nov 27
December was the only month of the entire year
that recorded normal temperatures and rainfall.
The first reports of wintry precipitation of the
season were made on the 16th as freezing rain
accumulated on tree limbs in the Upstate. Cold
air funneled into the region, and widespread
lows in the teens and 20s led to a hard freeze
across the state.
A strong cold front moved through the state on
Christmas Eve, causing damage from strong
gusts and straight-line winds and producing an
EF1 tornado in Clarendon County. Another blast
of cold Arctic air, behind the front, made it one
of the coldest Christmases in the state within the
last ten years. There were reports of snow flurries
near Seneca and even reports of flurries in
Islandton and at the Charleston International
Airport.
